# Dactyl ManuForm Keyboard

This is a fork of the [Dactyl-ManuForm](https://github.com/tshort/dactyl-keyboard). The Dactyl-Manuform is a fork of the [Dactyl](https://github.com/adereth/dactyl-keyboard) with the thumb cluster from [ManuForm](https://github.com/jeffgran/ManuForm). Some features from the Dactyl Manuform Mini are kept along with new features added. 

## Features

- The use of sidenubs can be disabled. Sidenub should be disabled if you use Kailh, and Outemu. If you use Cherry MX, Gateron or Zealios switches, you can enable the sidenubs.
- Toggle for outer column between using 1.5u sized keys and 1u sized keys.
- If enabled, the rows which use 1.5u sized keys can be specified.
- Toggle for an extra row of keys for the outer column(s).
- Toggle for an extra inner column before the thumbcluster with (nrows-2) rows.
- Toggle between using the default thumb cluster and mini thumb cluster designed by [l4u](https://github.com/l4u/dactyl-manuform-mini-keyboard).
- Removable controller board / TRRS jack holder as a separate part. This holder is then friction fit into a cutout on the back wall of the case. Designed for common TRRS breakout boards. 
- Models for both pro-micro and elite-c holders in the [things/](things/) directory.

* Use OpenSCAD to open a `.scad` file.
* Make changes to design, repeat `load-file`, OpenSCAD will watch for changes and rerender.
